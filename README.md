This Tetris project is a version of the classic puzzle game everyone must have played in our childhood. 

I used raylib libraries, which make the graphics and gameplay smooth, cool and easy to understand. All of the coding is done in Xcode IDE, which helped me make everything work just right without any error. 

While trying to run this project make sure you have raylib installed in your system and if you use Xcode make sure to add the raylib libraries path and include files in the header search path in the build setting and link the binary with libraries.
